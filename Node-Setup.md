## Node Setup
### Install Nodejs in your system
To install Node.js on your Windows machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org
1. On the Node.js website, click on the "Downloads" button. This will take you to the downloads page.
1. On the downloads page, you will see two versions: "LTS" (Long-Term Support) and "Current." The LTS version is recommended for most users as it provides stability and long-term support. Click on the "LTS" version to download it.
1. Once the installer file is downloaded, locate the file and double-click on it to run the installer.
1. The Node.js setup wizard will open. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the installation.
1. On the "Destination Folder" screen, you can choose the folder where Node.js will be installed. The default location is usually fine, so you can click on the "Next" button.
1. On the "Select components" screen, make sure that the "npm package manager" option is selected. This will install npm (Node Package Manager) along with Node.js. npm is used to install and manage packages/modules for Node.js.
1. Continue through the setup wizard by accepting the license agreement and choosing the appropriate options.
1. Finally, click on the "Install" button to start the installation process.
1. Once the installation is complete, you can close the setup wizard.
To verify that Node.js is installed correctly, open the Command Prompt or PowerShell and type the following command:
```bash
node -v
```
This command will display the installed version of Node.js. Additionally, you can also check the npm version by typing:
```bash
npm -v
```
Both commands should display the respective version numbers if the installation was successful.

That's it! Node.js is now installed on your Windows machine, and you can start using it to run JavaScript applications and work with various frameworks and libraries.
